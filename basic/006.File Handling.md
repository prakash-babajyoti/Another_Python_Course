### 6. **File Handling**

Python allows you to work with files in different modes, such as reading from files, writing to files, and appending to files. File handling is important when you need to store or retrieve data from external files.

#### 6.1 **Opening and Closing Files**

To work with files, you first need to open them. Python provides the built-in `open()` function to open a file. The syntax of the `open()` function is as follows:

```python
file = open(filename, mode)
```

- `filename`: The name of the file you want to open.
- `mode`: Specifies the mode in which the file is opened.

##### File Modes:
- `"r"` – Read mode (default): Opens a file for reading.
- `"w"` – Write mode: Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, its content will be overwritten. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created.
- `"a"` – Append mode: Opens a file for appending new content to the end of the file.
- `"b"` – Binary mode: Use this mode when working with non-text files (like images, audio files).

#### Example:
```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Open a file in read mode
file.close()  # Close the file after use
```

It's important to **close** the file after you are done working with it to free up system resources.

#### 6.2 **Using the `with` Statement**

A safer and more convenient way to handle files is using the `with` statement, which ensures that the file is closed automatically after the block of code is executed.

##### Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()  # Read the file content
    print(content)  # Output the content
# File is automatically closed here
```

#### 6.3 **Reading from a File**

There are multiple ways to read content from a file:
1. **`read()`**: Reads the entire file content as a string.
2. **`readline()`**: Reads one line at a time.
3. **`readlines()`**: Reads all lines and returns them as a list of strings.

##### Example of `read()`:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Outputs the entire file content
```

##### Example of `readline()`:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    line = file.readline()
    print(line)  # Outputs the first line of the file
```

##### Example of `readlines()`:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)  # Outputs a list of lines from the file
```

#### 6.4 **Writing to a File**

You can write to a file using the `write()` method. If the file doesn’t exist, Python will create a new file.

##### Example:
```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")
```

This will create (or overwrite) a file named `output.txt` with the specified content.

#### 6.5 **Appending to a File**

If you want to add content to an existing file without overwriting it, you can open the file in append mode (`"a"`).

##### Example:
```python
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nAppended line.")
```

This will add the new line at the end of `output.txt`.

#### 6.6 **Working with Binary Files**

When working with non-text files like images, videos, or audio files, you need to open the file in **binary mode** by adding `"b"` to the mode.

##### Example of reading a binary file:
```python
with open("image.jpg", "rb") as file:
    data = file.read()  # Read the binary content of the file
    print(data[:20])  # Print the first 20 bytes
```

##### Example of writing to a binary file:
```python
with open("copy_image.jpg", "wb") as file:
    file.write(data)  # Write binary content to a new file
```

#### 6.7 **File Methods Summary**:
- `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file as a string.
- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.
- `readlines()`: Reads all lines and returns them as a list of strings.
- `write()`: Writes content to a file (overwriting it).
- `writelines()`: Writes a list of strings to a file.
- `close()`: Closes the file after reading or writing.

### Exercise:
1. Write a Python program that reads a file named `example.txt` and prints its content.
2. Write a Python program that creates a new file called `notes.txt`, writes some text into it, and then appends an additional line.
3. Write a Python program that reads a binary file (such as an image) and copies it to a new file.
