Let's start from the basics and gradually move to more advanced topics. I will guide you through each concept step by step. Here’s a roadmap of Python topics we will cover:

1. **Introduction to Python**
2. **Data Types and Variables**
3. **Control Flow (if, else, for, while)**
4. **Functions**
5. **Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets)**
6. **File Handling**
7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
8. **Modules and Packages**
9. **Exception Handling**
10. **Decorators and Generators**
11. **Advanced Python Concepts (e.g., Context Managers, Iterators, etc.)**

We’ll start with **Introduction to Python** and move on from there.

### 1. **Introduction to Python**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It’s widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

#### Key Features of Python:
- **Readable Syntax**: Python’s syntax is designed to be intuitive and readable.
- **Dynamic Typing**: No need to declare variable types explicitly; Python infers the type.
- **Interpreted Language**: Code is executed line-by-line, making debugging easier.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: There are thousands of libraries and frameworks for various domains like machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), web development (e.g., Django, Flask), and automation (e.g., Selenium).
  
#### Example: A simple Python program
Let’s begin by writing a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!".

```python
# This is a comment in Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

- `print()` is a built-in Python function that displays the output to the console.
- Text inside quotes (`"Hello, World!"`) is a **string**, a basic data type in Python.

#### Running Python Code
You can run Python code in various environments:
- **Interactive Shell**: Python’s interactive mode allows you to run code one line at a time.
- **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments (like PyCharm, VS Code) support writing and running Python code.
- **Online Platforms**: Websites like Replit or Google Colab allow you to write and execute Python code online.

#### Exercise:
Try writing a Python program that prints your name and age.
