### 3. **Control Flow**

Control flow allows you to direct the execution of your program by making decisions and repeating tasks based on conditions. In Python, we primarily use conditional statements and loops to control the flow of our programs.

#### 3.1. **Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)**

Conditional statements help you execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

##### Syntax of `if` statement:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True
```

##### Syntax of `if-else` statement:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code block to execute if condition is False
```

##### Syntax of `if-elif-else` statement:
```python
if condition_1:
    # Code block to execute if condition_1 is True
elif condition_2:
    # Code block to execute if condition_2 is True
else:
    # Code block to execute if both conditions are False
```

#### Example:
```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

##### Output:
```
You are an adult.
```

#### Example with `elif`:
```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

##### Output:
```
Grade: B
```

#### Logical Operators in Conditions:
- `and`: Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.
- `or`: Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.
- `not`: Reverses the boolean value of the condition.

Example with `and` and `or`:
```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x > 0 and y > 0:
    print("Both numbers are positive.")
    
if x > 0 or y < 0:
    print("At least one number is positive.")
```

##### Output:
```
Both numbers are positive.
At least one number is positive.
```

### 3.2. **Loops**  
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python provides two types of loops:
1. **`for` loop**
2. **`while` loop**

#### 3.2.1 **`for` Loop**:
A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers.

##### Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

##### Output:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

You can also use the `range()` function to loop over a sequence of numbers.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

##### Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

#### 3.2.2 **`while` Loop**:
A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`.

##### Example:
```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

##### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### 3.3. **`break` and `continue` Statements**:

- **`break`**: Terminates the loop completely.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

##### Example with `break`:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

##### Output:
```
1
2
```

##### Example with `continue`:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

##### Output:
```
1
2
4
5
```

#### Nested Loops:
You can also have loops inside loops.

##### Example:
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 3):
        print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
```

##### Output:
```
i: 1, j: 1
i: 1, j: 2
i: 2, j: 1
i: 2, j: 2
i: 3, j: 1
i: 3, j: 2
```

### Exercise:
1. Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-elif-else`.
2. Create a `for` loop to print all even numbers from 1 to 10.
3. Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5, but skips the number 3 using `continue`.
