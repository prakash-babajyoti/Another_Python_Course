### 5. **Data Structures**

Python has several built-in data structures that allow you to store and organize data efficiently. We will cover the following:

1. **Lists**
2. **Tuples**
3. **Dictionaries**
4. **Sets**

#### 5.1 **Lists**

A **list** is an ordered collection of items that can hold a variety of data types (integers, strings, etc.). Lists are **mutable**, meaning their elements can be modified after they are created.

##### Creating a List:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14]
```

##### Accessing List Elements:
You can access elements in a list using **indexing** (starting from 0).

```python
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana
```

##### Modifying a List:
```python
fruits[1] = "orange"  # Replace "banana" with "orange"
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry']
```

##### List Operations:
- **Appending** an element:
    ```python
    fruits.append("grape")
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'grape']
    ```
  
- **Removing** an element:
    ```python
    fruits.remove("cherry")
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
    ```

- **Slicing**:
    ```python
    print(numbers[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
    ```

- **Checking membership**:
    ```python
    print("apple" in fruits)  # Output: True
    ```

##### Example:
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
numbers.append(60)
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```

#### 5.2 **Tuples**

A **tuple** is similar to a list, but it is **immutable**, meaning the elements cannot be changed once the tuple is created. Tuples are useful for data that should remain constant throughout the program.

##### Creating a Tuple:
```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

##### Accessing Tuple Elements:
```python
print(colors[0])  # Output: red
```

##### Tuple Unpacking:
You can assign the values of a tuple to variables directly.

```python
r, g, b = colors
print(r)  # Output: red
print(g)  # Output: green
print(b)  # Output: blue
```

##### Example:
```python
person = ("John", 25, "New York")
name, age, city = person
print(name)  # Output: John
print(age)   # Output: 25
print(city)  # Output: New York
```

#### 5.3 **Dictionaries**

A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value, and keys must be unique. Dictionaries are **mutable**, meaning you can modify them after creation.

##### Creating a Dictionary:
```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "major": "Physics"}
```

##### Accessing Dictionary Elements:
You can access values using their keys.

```python
print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice
```

##### Modifying a Dictionary:
```python
student["age"] = 26  # Update the age
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'major': 'Physics'}
```

##### Adding Key-Value Pairs:
```python
student["grade"] = "A"
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'major': 'Physics', 'grade': 'A'}
```

##### Dictionary Methods:
- **`keys()`**: Returns a list of keys.
- **`values()`**: Returns a list of values.
- **`items()`**: Returns a list of key-value pairs.

##### Example:
```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "major": "Physics"}
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

##### Output:
```
name: Alice
age: 25
major: Physics
```

#### 5.4 **Sets**

A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful when you want to store items without duplicates.

##### Creating a Set:
```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

##### Adding and Removing Elements:
```python
fruits.add("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}

fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'orange'}
```

##### Set Operations:
- **Union**: Combines two sets.
    ```python
    set1 = {1, 2, 3}
    set2 = {3, 4, 5}
    union_set = set1.union(set2)
    print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    ```
  
- **Intersection**: Finds common elements.
    ```python
    intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
    print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}
    ```

- **Difference**: Finds elements in one set but not in the other.
    ```python
    difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
    print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
    ```

#### Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

### Exercise:
1. Create a list of 5 numbers and append one more number to the list.
2. Create a tuple with three colors and use tuple unpacking to assign each color to a variable.
3. Create a dictionary of a personâ€™s details (name, age, city), then add a new key-value pair (e.g., occupation).
4. Create a set of 5 unique numbers, then add a new number to the set and perform union and intersection with another set.
